# Vast S3 Output Port Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Use this template to create an Output Port backed by an S3 area on the [VAST Data](https://www.vastdata.com/) platform.

> Before using this template, replace the placeholder GitLab group (`your-gitlab-group`) in [`template.yaml`](./template.yaml) with the GitLab group that should own the repositories created by this template.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/data-teams/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates#getting-started).

This template uses Skeleton Entities.

### What's an Output Port?

An Output Port refers to the interface that a Data Product uses to provide data to other components or systems within the organization. The methods of data sharing can range from APIs to file exports and database links.

### VAST Data

VAST Data is a unified storage and data platform designed to remove the traditional trade-offs between performance, capacity and cost for large-scale, all-flash environments. It exposes an S3-compatible object storage interface on top of the platform's shared data store, letting Output Ports serve files directly out of a bucket and path without duplicating data onto separate storage.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://www.vastdata.com/).
